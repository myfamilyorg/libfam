 * Initializes the global memory allocator with the given initial chunk count.
 * inputs:

 * return value: i32 - 0 on success, -1 on error with errno set.
 * errors:
 *         EINVAL         - if chunks == 0.
 *         ENOMEM         - if initial allocation fails.
 * notes:
 *         Must be called once before any alloc/resize/release calls.
 *         Automatically called via INIT_GLOBAL_ALLOCATOR if used.
 *         Idempotent: safe to call multiple times (subsequent calls are
 * no-ops). Sets up internal Alloc instance (see alloc.h).

 * errors:

 * notes:
 *         If ptr is NULL, behaves like alloc(new_size).
 *         Contents up to min(old_size, new_size) are preserved.
 *         Returned pointer may differ from ptr; old pointer becomes invalid.

 * notes:
 *         Uses a constructor function to call init_global_allocator(chunks).
 *         Must be placed at file scope in exactly one translation unit.
 *         Ensures allocator is ready before main() or any static initializers.
