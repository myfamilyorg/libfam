# Overview

Libfam comes with formatting/printing utilities that are meant to be used in the place of printf and other stdandard library tools. The design includes The Formatter struct which has the format_append, format_clear and format_to_stirng functions. These allow for building formatted strings iteratively. Next we have the FORMAT macro which can be used to format text. Finally, we have the println/print/panic macros which can output text to the screen (updated printf functions). The macros automiatcally detect the type using the "_Generic" macro capabilities in C. This includes the integer types, floating point types, strings, and addresses.


# Examples

FORMAT:

```
Formatter f = FORMATTER_INIT;
FORMAT(&f, "a={},b={}", 1, 2);
FORMAT(&f, ",c={},d={}", 3, 4);
const u8 *s = format_to_string(&f);
write(2, s, strlen(s));
```

Or, FORMAT can be used indirectly by using the println/print/panic macros:

```
println("a={},b={},c={},d={},s={}", 1, 2, 3, 4, "string");
```

print is just like println, but without a newline and panic is like println, but exits after printing is complete.

All of these macros support several display options. For instance {c} - char, {b} - binary, {x} - lower case hex, {X} upper case hex and {n} for comma formatting.

For example:

```
println("a={c},b={b},c={x},d={X},e={n}", 'a', 3, 0xFF, 0xFF, 1234567);
```

Would print out:

```
a=a,b=11,c=0xff,d=0xFF,e=1,234,567
```

For floating point numbers, precision can be specified with the '.' symbol.

```
println("x={.4}", 1.23456789);
```

The output of this is:

```
x=1.2345
```

In addition, {:NNN}, {:<NNN}, and {:>NNN} can be used for alignment of text.
```
println("a={:10},b={:<5},c={:>5}", 1, 1, 1);
```

The output of this is:

```
a=          1,b=1    ,c=    1
```

Finally, the '{{' and '}}' symbols can used to display a single '{' and '}' respectively:

```
println("v={{,w=}} {}", "test");
```

The output is:

```
v={,w=} test
```

# Architecture/Design

At its core all the functions use the Formatter type and the functions that are defined for it. They progressively reallocate the buffer as needed using [Resize](https://myfamilyorg.github.io/libfam/alloc). Based on this core functionality we extend formatting in a number of different directions (print, println, panic, ASSERT, ASSERT_EQ). We iterate efficiently through using an aho corasick-like algorithm for efficient matching. This allows for functionality similar to StringBuilder in java with the formatting syntax similar to Rust.
